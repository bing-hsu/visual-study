    <p class="scroll-text right-align passage">
        Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both
        regression and classification problems.
        Decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which each leaf node corresponds to a class
        label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree.
        We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree.

        At the beginning, we consider the whole training set as the root.
        Feature values are preferred to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to
        building the model.
        On the basis of attribute values records are distributed recursively.
        We use statistical methods for ordering attributes as root or the internal node.

        Information Gain
        When we use a node in a decision tree to partition the training instances into smaller subsets the entropy
        changes. Information gain is a measure of this change in entropy.
        Definition: Suppose S is a set of instances, A is an attribute, Sv is the subset of S with A = v, and Values (A)
        is the set of all possible values of A, then

        Entropy
        Entropy is the measure of uncertainty of a random variable, it characterizes the impurity of an arbitrary
        collection of examples. The higher the entropy more the information content.

        A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible
        consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an
        algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.
        Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a
        strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.
